## Project rules

- Auth uses mobile + password; mobile maps to a synthetic email via `mobileToEmail` in src/lib/data.ts (auto-confirm on) — real email is optional profile data.
- First registered account becomes admin (handle_new_user trigger); roles live only in public.user_roles, checked via has_role in RLS.
- Plot data is read client-side via shared queryOptions in src/lib/data.ts; realtime on `plots` in __root invalidates the cache so charts stay live.
- Geographic plot maps use Google Maps with saved coordinate pairs only; shared pure plot-information helpers drive search and missing-data indicators.
- Plot edits are audited by a database trigger into admin-read-only history without a plot foreign key so deleted records retain history; changed factual details invalidate the separate admin information verification.
- Ownership files are private and case-scoped to assigned customers, admins and officers; the existing database review function enforces admin-or-officer authorization and records decisions in the existing audit trail, avoiding parallel review workflows.
- Ownership notifications are persistent in-app notices; customer ownership queries are keyed by identity and cleared on sign-out to avoid cross-account cache exposure.
